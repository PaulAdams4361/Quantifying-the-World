# Imputation of Housing Data

## Summary

Strategies for dealing with missing data are a necessary component of the analysis of any new dataset. In most cases, rather than removing records containing missing values, the preferred method is making an educated guess as to what the missing value might be and imputing the datapoint with a best guess estimate. Imputation is a method that preserves the useful data present within a dataset, while providing machine learning algorithms with the complete data they demand.
