# Prediction Spam Email Messages

## Summary

Email usage has become so ubiquitous that having an email address is just as common as having a phone number. 
A brief examination of the benefits of using email reveals why. 
Email is a cost effective means of mass communication.
Free services, such as gmail,
 make having an email address possible for anyone with an internet connection and a device that can send the message. 

Advertisers gravitate to the use of all accessible and efficient communication methods, and email fits this description well. 
Some advertisers send messages so frequently, that they irritate address owners,
 who then seek ways to end the stream of advertisements coming to their email address. 
Automatic filters that detect unwanted email advertisements, called spam, using machine learning and natural language processing. 

This case study will demonstrate how to build a spam filter using an email dataset.
