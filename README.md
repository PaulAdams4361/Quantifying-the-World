Quantifying the World

* Case Study 1: [Predicting Location via Indoor Positioning Systems](./case_study_1)
  * In this case study, we assess whether it is possible to predict locations based on the measurement of WiFi signals from fixed access points (AP).
* Case Study 2: [Cherry Blossom Race Runner's Times](./case_study_2)
  * In this case study we collect data on participants of the Cherry Blossom Race from the event website.
* Case Study 3: [Prediction Spam Email Messages](./case_study_3)
  * This case study will demonstrate how to build a spam filter using an email dataset.
* Case Study 4: [Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM](./case_study_4)
  * This study applies Random Forest, XGBoost, and an SVM to the same data set and the models are then compared in terms of processing speed, model accuracy, and model loss.
* Case Study 5: [Imputation of Housing Data](./case_study_5)
  * In this case study, we analyze the missingness of data and create imputations in the Russian Housing Dataset.
* Case Study 6: [Searching for the Higgs Boson with Deep Learning](./case_study_6)
  * In this case study, we replicate the paper “Searching for Exotic Particles in High-energy Physics with Deep Learning” by Baldi, P., P. Sadowski, and D. Whiteson.
