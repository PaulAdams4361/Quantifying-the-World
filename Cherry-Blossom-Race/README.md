# Cherry Blossom Race Runner's Times

## Summary

The internet is a vast open resource for data, but internet data can be messy and difficult to wrangle.

We find that there are a number of issues present in the data, 
 including inconsistent web addressing formatting, inconsistent formatting, and missing data. 
We collect and clean this data to provide the Men's and Women's information in a format suitable for analysis.
